Ozzie is your testing friend. Ozzie will take an screenshot during integration tests whenever you need. Ozzie will capture performance reports for you.

## How it works

Add `ozzie` to your `pubspec.yaml` as a **dev_dependency**:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  ozzie: <latest_version_here>
```

In your Flutter integration tests, create an instance of `Ozzie`, pass the `FlutterDriver`, give it a `groupName` and ask it to `takeScreenshot`. That simple! And whenever you have finished with tests, you can create an HTML report by asking `Ozzie` to `generateHtmlReport`.

If you want to measure the performance of your app, simple wrap your integration tests in `profilePerformance` and it will be added to the HTML report.

Here's an example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_driver/flutter_driver.dart';
import 'package:test/test.dart';
import 'package:ozzie/ozzie.dart';

void main() {
  FlutterDriver driver;
  Ozzie ozzie;

  setUpAll(() async {
    driver = await FlutterDriver.connect();
    ozzie = Ozzie.initWith(driver, groupName: 'counter');
  });

  tearDownAll(() async {
    if (driver != null) driver.close();
    ozzie.generateHtmlReport();
  });

  test('initial counter is 0', () async {
    await ozzie.profilePerformance('counter0', () async {
      await driver.waitFor(find.text('0'));
      await ozzie.takeScreenshot('initial_counter_is_0');
    });
  });

  test('initial counter is 0', () async {
    await ozzie.profilePerformance('counter1', () async {
      await driver.tap(find.byType('FloatingActionButton'));
      await driver.waitFor(find.text('1'));
      await ozzie.takeScreenshot('counter_is_1');
    });
  });
}
```

After this, a report will be generated inside your project as `ozzie/index.html`:

### Using ozzie.yaml to control performance thresholds

You can declare, at the root of your project, an `ozzie.yaml` file to control the different thresholds of your performance tests. If this file is not declared, `Ozzie` will use internal default values:

`ozzie.yaml`:

```yaml
integration_test_expectations:
  should_fail_build_on_warning: true
  should_fail_build_on_error: true
performance_metrics:
  missed_frames_threshold:
    warning_percentage: 5.0
    error_percentage: 10.0
  frame_build_rate_threshold:
    warning_time_in_millis: 14.0
    error_time_in_millis: 16.0
  frame_rasterizer_rate_threshold:
    warning_time_in_millis: 14.0
    error_time_in_millis: 16.0
```

### Optional screenshots

Taking screenshots can take a while, and sometimes you might want to run your integration tests without taking screenshots. If that's the case, you can set `shouldTakeScreenshots` to `false` and skip that part, saving you some precious time:

```dart
setUpAll(() async {
  driver = await FlutterDriver.connect();
  ozzie = Ozzie.initWith(
    driver,
    groupName: 'counter',
    shouldTakeScreenshots: false,
  );
});
```
